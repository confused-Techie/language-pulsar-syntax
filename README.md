# Language Pulsar Syntax

A simple Text Mate Grammar intended to highlight `.pulsar-syntax` files, to help showcase the way in which a certain Pulsar Theme may highlight or otherwise style a grammar.

If you'd like to test a theme you are developing, or test a language you are assigning scopes too, feel free to install the `language-pulsar-syntax` Pulsar Package, to be able to highlight any `.pulsar-syntax` files.

Then grab the example syntax files from this repo, and right away you'll be able to test how syntax highlighting looks at different scopes with your current theme!
